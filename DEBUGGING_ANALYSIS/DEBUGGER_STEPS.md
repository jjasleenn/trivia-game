 ## Breakpoint 2: score display
 ### Location:line 126
### Explanation: 
1. The protocol for retrieving the score from the scoreboard and its subsequent updates.
2. An inspection of the proper appending process for the new score.
3. The updated score appears correctly in the display following any modification.

### What Changed After Stepping Through:
1. The score appears immediately after responding to a question.
2. Does localStorage.setItem("scores", JSON.stringify(scores)) work?
3. The HTML table correctly represents the scores.

### Critical State Analysis:
Player trust heavily relies on the score display system which transforms stored data into visible achievements for players. The system operates three essential procedures including JSON parsing of localStorage content and score sorting and dynamic DOM element creation because these functions are prone to failures that produce disruptive impacts on gameplay

 ## Breakpoint 3: Management cookie
 ### Location: line 159

 ### Explanation: 
Through the cookie system the application stores usernames to manage gameplay states between page reloads. This requirement remains crucial to operations because it directly controls:
1. User identification
2. Score attribution
3. When managing state in user interfaces the username input will become temporarily disabled during its use.


### What Changed After Stepping Through:
1. The input field for username becomes disabled only when the cookie exists
2. Viewing capabilities of the New Player button depend on user cookie status
### Critical State Analysis:
1. Standard cookie handling protocols of browsers differs resulting in Browser Compliance to be unreliable
2. The precise formatting of strings in Document.cookie constitutes a requirement for operation success.
3. The system experiences race conditions when reading or writing cookies due to timing conflicts between operations.
